# Creating and Implementing Cybersecurity Program-Team Sprint (WiCyS-Clicked/IBM Skillbuild)


## Overview
Performed the role of a cybersecurity analyst to create and implement a cybersecurity program in an enterprise environment. The team sprint offered a dynamic and collaborative learning environment where the teams engaged in real-world like business challenges, guided by Clicked Coaches. The goal the team sprint is to produce tangible deliverables contributing to a comprehensive recommendation or solution that aligns with company's service offerings.

## Scenario - Lemonade - Cybersecurity Program
Lemonade, an online insurance company that covers everything from pets to laptops to your home, has been in the process of having an external team work on a cybersecurity program for them to implement. Being a small company, there was no program in place up until now. Lemonade is seeking out a comprehensive program that makes sense for their size and service offerings, most especially as they launched their AI model to predict catastrophes and claims, and uses that data to price their policies.
