## Scenario - Lemonade - Cybersecurity Program
Lemonade, an online insurance company that covers everything from pets to laptops to your home, has been in the process of having an external team work on a cybersecurity program for them to implement. Being a small company, there was no program in place up until now. Lemonade is seeking out a comprehensive program that makes sense for their size and service offerings, most especially as they launched their AI model to predict catastrophes and claims, and uses that data to price their policies.
